% the simple case of approximating first-order 
% autoregressive process with Markov chain

% y_t = lambda * y_(t-1) + u_t

% u_t is a Gaussian white noise process with standard deviation sigma.

% m determines the width of discretized state space, Tauchen uses m=3
% ymax=m*vary,ymin=-m*vary, ymax and ymin are two boundary points

% N is the number of possible states chosen to approximate
% the y_t process, usually N=9 should be fine

% Tran is the transition matrix of the Markov chain

% s is the discretized state space of y_t

% alambda is the theoretical first order autoregression coefficient 
% for Markov chain

% asigma is the theoretical standard deviation for Markov chain Y_t
